// src/db/cleanup.js
// Daily job-lifecycle cleanup — separate from sync.js on purpose (sync.js
// is scoped to "talk to providers and save results"; this file is scoped
// to "decide what no longer belongs in the database"). Wired into the
// Worker's scheduled() handler via a second cron pattern in wrangler.toml.

// A job is deleted once EITHER condition is true:
//  - expires_at has passed (our own computed 45-day lease, extended every
//    time a sync still finds the job at its source)
//  - updated_at is more than 30 days old (the source has stopped
//    returning this job for over a month — treated as gone for good)
// These two thresholds overlap in practice (expires_at is set from
// updated_at + 45 days, so the 30-day rule usually fires first), which is
// intentional: the shorter of the two always wins, so a source that
// briefly hiccups doesn't lose jobs prematurely, while a source that goes
// fully silent doesn't hold onto stale listings for the full 45 days.
